7. Classes I think we need:
	- Product
	- Cart
	- Discount (interface, FlatDiscount, PercentageDiscount, 
		ThresholdDiscount)
	- Tax
	- Billing
	- Invoice
	- Storage (interface, FileStorage, DBStorage)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Class Responsibilities: 
	Product:
		- holds immutable data

		- calculates subtotal
	Discount:
		- calculate discount amount
		- set discount (flat amount, rate, threshold) in constructor
	Tax:
		- calculate tax amount
		- update tax rate
	Billing:
		- calculate final payable bill
		- generate bill data
	Invoice:
		- display invoice in console
	Storage:
		- store invoice in file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
